        "en": "Thank you for participating in the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study! These surveys will help us learn more about your child's development. There will be questions about your child, yourself, and your family and home.\n\nYou can only answer each question once, but you can change your answers before you submit each survey. There are no right or wrong answers, but it's important to answer truthfully. Some questions are about things from the past or what you've seen. If you can't remember or are not sure, just make your best guess. Your answers will be kept confidential.\n\nWhen you need breaks, you can take one between surveys. Just be sure to finish and submit the survey you're doing before your leave the page so your answers are saved. When you click the survey link again, you will start the next survey.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, we are happy to help! Please contact your HBCD team for more information.\n\nThank you for your participation!"
